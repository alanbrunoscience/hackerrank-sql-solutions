# HackerRank SQL Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the SQL challenges on HackerRank.

The goal of this project is to:
- Practice and improve my SQL skills.
- Document my thought process and solutions for future reference.
- Share my work with the community.

Each solution is organized by challenge name and includes the SQL query used to solve the problem.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest alternative solutions!
